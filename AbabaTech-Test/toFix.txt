+ It would be better to create some kind of a hook to handle form inputs (e.g. AuthForm)
+ There are left debug console.log in the code base
+ Http requests logic should be moved to some services, so they are reusable (e.g. AuthForm)
- There are some random setTimeout (AuthForm, CreateMovieButton)
- Some components name do not match with what actually is happening - e.g. "CreateMovieButton" should be just a button form the name, but it also does the creation stuff
- Inconsistent code base - sometimes ES6 arrow functions are used, sometimes "funciton" syntax is used
- Pagination logic should be moved to reusable component
- Filtering/sorting etc. logic should be made in the backend
- Routes should be moved to constants and not left in strings (reusability issue)
- Inconsistent logic - some parts are moved to services for Http requests, some are not
+ Both in frontend and backend codebase was not cleaned up after initial setup
+ Commit messages does not say what was done
- Validations were not used
